# Graphical abstract package

Recommended graphical abstract candidate in this repository:

- `paper/fig_workflow.png`

Rationale:

- It summarizes the software pipeline from inputs to calibrated outputs.
- It visually emphasizes reproducibility and interoperability layers.

If SoftwareX submission system requires specific pixel dimensions, export a resized copy from `paper/fig_workflow.png` before upload and keep content unchanged.
