Dear Editors of SoftwareX,

Please find attached our manuscript entitled:

"saxsabs: Reproducible absolute intensity calibration software for small-angle X-ray scattering"

for consideration as a software article in SoftwareX.

This submission presents `saxsabs`, an open-source Python software package for SAXS absolute intensity calibration workflows. The software provides a tested calibration-control layer that complements established integration and analysis tools by addressing practical reproducibility challenges in routine beamline operation, including heterogeneous metadata parsing, robust K-factor estimation, multi-standard support, attenuation calculations, buffer subtraction, and interoperable canSAS/NXcanSAS export.

The software is publicly available under a BSD-3-Clause license and includes:

- a modular Python package,
- command-line reproducibility workflows,
- a bilingual GUI workbench for operational use,
- automated cross-platform tests in CI,
- and a deterministic minimal anonymized 2D reproducibility package suitable for reviewer verification when proprietary raw beamline data cannot be shared.

We confirm that:

1. This manuscript is original and has not been published elsewhere.
2. The manuscript is not under consideration by any other journal.
3. All authors have approved the manuscript and its submission.
4. There are no competing financial or personal interests affecting this work.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
