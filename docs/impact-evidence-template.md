# Impact evidence template

Use this template to maintain quantitative software-impact evidence for JOSS review updates and post-publication reporting.

## Reporting period

- Start date:
- End date:
- Beamline/facility context:

## Usage metrics

- Number of calibration runs:
- Number of external 1D conversion runs:
- Number of unique users/projects:

## Efficiency metrics

- Median processing time before saxsabs (minutes/run):
- Median processing time with saxsabs (minutes/run):
- Estimated total operator time saved (hours):

## Reliability metrics

- Pre-saxsabs failure rate due to format/header issues (%):
- Post-saxsabs failure rate due to format/header issues (%):
- Number of runs requiring manual intervention:

## Traceability metrics

- Percentage of runs with complete calibration metadata logs:
- Percentage of runs with reproducible CLI replay records:

## Evidence attachments

- Link to anonymized log exports:
- Link to representative output reports:
- Link to related publications/preprints (if available):
